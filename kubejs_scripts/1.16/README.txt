I advise condensing these into a single file (I don't think you can make optional recipe loads with KubeJS, so I divided them on a per-mod basis).

Each one's required mod is in its filename, and you can open it to view the recipes if you want to (best to use VSCode for .js files if you didn't know already).

You should just be able to toss them into your modpack (alongside the datapack) & be set, though.

KubeJS might print some errors about tags not existing, and if it does just remove the lines for the empty tags.
