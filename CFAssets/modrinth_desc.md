## _A direct download for the KubeJS recipe files can be found [here](https://github.com/vizthex123/DyeUnifier/tree/main/kubejs_scripts)!_

I got tired of having to constantly edit my [dye recipe fixer script](https://github.com/vizthex123/viz-projects/blob/main/hi-tech-revolution/kubejs_scripts/server_scripts/dye_fixer.js) whenever I re-used it in a modpack, so I figured I'd quickly throw together a datapack that auto-tags all the things for me.

Recipes are handled by a [KubeJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs) script included as an additional file attached to each version's download (since that's easier to edit, and datapacks can't remove recipes), so you'll have to either make your own script or grab one of the example scripts I made.
